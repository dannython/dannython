so today we will discuss about 

Inheritance
is a relationship vs has a relationship
final keyword
Scanner class

***********************************************************************

what do you mean by OOPS concept
Object oriented programming

Java support OOPS concept

there are OOPS concept like
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Abstraction
Encapsulation
Class and Object



Inheritance------------what is inheritance
inheritance means acquiring the properties of parent class to the child class that is Inheritance concept


what is the benefit of inheritance(reusability)

means with the help of child class object, we can call the parent variable and parent method



extends is the keyword use for inheritance





After : whatever is written that is the return type of that method
After - whatever is written that means that method belong to that class

multiple inheritance------------Abstraction in java


****************************************************************************




is a vs has a relationship

what is the difference between is a relationship and has a relationship


As of now we have seeen we can create the object of a class in the main method in the same class---Yes

creation of the object of a class in the another class we call it has a relationship



has a relationship

creation of the object of a class in the another class with in same package/in the different package

and in the different project------------------> that is also possible



java has given a class named Scanner class 
that class will be used for taking inputs from the user

if i create the object of Scanner class in my class ------------------> what is this concept
has a relationship


how we can call the method of Scanner class ?

by creating the object of Scanner class 

public class Scanner
{
  public int nextint()
  {

  }
  public float nextfloat() 
  {

 }
}



we can take the value at runtime


if we don't want to fix the value in the code, how we can take 
with the help of Scanner class 



what do you mean by variable ?
which store some value and value can be change

constant
which store some value and value can't be change


with the help of final keyword, we can make constant in java


if we make a class as a final, we can't inherit that class

that is the predefined class, that is given by java
you can call the method of that class by creating the object of that class

control+space Scann then use control+space

Assignment1

((((x1+x2)+x3)-x4)/x5)*x6)


Assignment2

(((((x1*x2)-x3)+x4)-x5)/x6)


Assignment3

Practice of Inheritance and is a vs has a relationship

Assignment4

Practice of the final keyword for making constant and final class
