so today we will discuss about 

static keyword
has a relationship(in case of different project)
final method


*****************************************************************

whar do you mean by has a relationship ?
creation of the object of a class in the another class we call it has a relationship with in the same package or in the different package.


we can create the object of a class in the another class in the different project as well, that is also possible.


how it is possible ?


in case of maven project we will get a file named pom.xml


maven will create the jar file of the project and it will keep the jar file in the target folder


clean goal----------------it will delete the old jars or the existing data from the target folder

package goal--------------it will create the jar file of the project


maven will keep the jar file in the target folder



how we will run these goals



 No compiler is provided in this environment. Perhaps you are running on a JRE rather than a JDK?

we have to give jdk to our project 






static method-----------------------
if we make some method as a static the benefit is that we can call that method/variable directly using classname.



each object having its own memory



if we make something as a static, where memory will be allocated---------at the class level



another benefit is that we can call the static variable/static method using classname directly



we can  call a static method or static variable
using classname
using refernece_variable also



a static method can use only static variable
a static method can't use non static variable


a non static method can use both(static variable or non static variable)




we can define static keyword with global variable only not local variable





static to static---------------------4 ways

1) using reference_variable
2) using classname
3) using this keyword
4) direct call


non static to static---------------4 ways


1) using reference_variable
2) using classname
3) using this keyword
4) direct call


static to non static------------------1 way

1) using reference_variable








Assignment1----------jar file practice

Assignment2---------static keyword practice

static to static
non static to static
static to non static
