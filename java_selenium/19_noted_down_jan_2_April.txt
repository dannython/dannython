so today we will discuss about xpath

xpath is also a locating technique like id,name,classname and cssselector

xpath is the hierarchical path of any element.

there are two type of the xpath
absoluate xpath
relative xpath


for example we have a button
<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>
<BODY>
<DIV>
<BUTTON id="Abc"/>


absoluate xpath that will be like this   /HTML/HEAD/TITLE/BODY/DIV/BUTTON
relative xpath that will be like this     //BUTTON or //DIV/BUTTON

THERE are some techniques for making the relative xpath as well


1) tag with attribute          //tagname[@attributename='attributeValue']
By.xpath("yourSyntex")); By.id

//input[@id='email']


2) tag with multiple attribute   with and condition and means both the conditions must be true

//tagname[@attname1='attvalue1' and @attname2='attvalue2']

//input[@id='email' and @name='email']

3) tag with multiple attribute   with or condition or means any of  the condition must be true

//tagname[@attname1='attvalue1' or @attname2='attvalue2']

//input[@id='email' or @name='email']


//input[@id='email' or @name='email1']

4) main benefit of the xpath is that we can handle the dynamic things
dymanic means which change again and again

in a html following things can be dynamic
tag name
attribute name
attribute value 
inner text -----------------the text between opening tag and closing tag that is innertext < >welcome dc </>


4) when tag name is dynamic 

//*[@attributename='attributevalue']



//*[@id='email']

any tag having attribute id with value email



5) when attribute name is dynamic 
//tagname[@*='value']

//*[@*='email' ]

any tag having any attribute with value email

6) tag with inner text where inner text is fixed

//tagname[text()='innertextValue']

//h2[text()='Facebook helps you connect and share with the people in your life.']

7) tag with dynamic inner text where inner text is changing again and again


Facebook helps you connect and share with the people in your life.

Facebook helps you connect 

Facebook helps you connect and share 

Facebook helps 

//tagname[contains(text(),'commonValue')]


//h2[contains(text(),'Facebook helps ')]


8) tag with dynamic attribute value

//tagname[contains(@attributename,'commonvalue')]




u_h_5_Dw

u_2_5_+i

//input[contains(@id,'u_')]


9) use of the indexing


 //input[contains(@id,'u_')][7]







 (//input[contains(@id,'u_')])[7]
