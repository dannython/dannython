so today we will discuss about

drop down handling
junit concept


we have two kind of the drop downs

1) in the select tag ----------------------if it is in the select tag then we will use select class for it
2) or in some other tag-----------------if it is in the some other tag then we will use actions class for it



today we will discuss about select class


there are three ways given by the select class

1) select by index------------------------in this case we will passs the index number of the item that we want to select and indexing will start from 0
2) select by visibiletext-----------------in this case we will pass the visible value from the drop down of the item that we want to select

3) select by value-----------------------in this case we will use the HTML, we will take the value from the html and the corresponding item to that value will be selected
