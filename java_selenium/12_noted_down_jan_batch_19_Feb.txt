so today we will discuss about text file handling

1) how to read the data character by character from txt file
2) how to read the data line by line from txt file
3) how to write single line
4) how to write multiple lines
5) how to append the data in existing file

before reading/writing/appending the data in a txt file we have to create a connection with the file, we can create the connection using predefined class that is File class




because in my code i have given the path of the desktop for the file and after that i am sharing my code with xyz so what is the limitation for xyz person. xyz person has to keep the file at the same location

so what is the good coding practice
we will keep the file with the 


projects


location-----------------absoluate path of the file(from the system)
relative path------------gibing the project reference(/DChanana/dc12.txt)


relatvie path will start from ..(double dot)


explicit data type conversion
because char is a small data type comparing to the int



FIleReader is the class used for reading character by character
BufferedReader is the class used for reading line by line


how to write a single line in the file

BufferedWriter


whether file exist or not-----------if yes-------------then it will override
                                             if no---------------------then it will create a new file
