Let suppose i want to share my code with Akshat 

How i can share my code 

or I need the code written by Akshat

How i can take that code

one of the good topic that is source code management tool or we can say version control tool

we will use source code management tool for sharing the code with in a team 


there are a number of source code management tools or version control tool like
github
bitbucket
SVN
TFS

these are the souce code management tool, you can mention in your resume github/bitbucket

the way of working is same for all source code management tool

github 



workspace-------------workspace is the location in your system wherre code will be saved.


workspace----------->to the local repository------------>



you need to create an account on the github.com



each centralized repository having a unique URL 


there are two ways for code push and code pull

1) you can use eclipse interface for code push and code pull, internally eclipse also use git commands for code push and code pull----------------for centralized repo link we will select HTTPS option

2) we can use git commands directly for code push and code pull----------we will select SSH option


from workspace to local repo---------
Team-----------share project

it can be on bitbucket 
it can be on github


centralized repository----------------URL you will get from the devops team



centralized repo

https://github.com/deepakchanana/janBatch.git



local repo---------------->centralized repo








we need to generate a key here on the github.com



go to settings------------> then Developers Setting--------->Personal Access tokens




https://github.com/deepakchanana/janBatch.git

Unstage---------------it will show those files in which we have done the changes
Stage-------------------here we will keep those files which we want to push



let suppose if you are doing the changes in some file or you adding some file or you deleting some file 
then you need to do the commit and push

file1-------------you have already push this file to the centralized repo

then what will be the worth to push the same file


this is the one time activity------------------->from workspace to the local repository




you don't need to take care of these things----------------

repository will be paid----------------because your company doesn't want to share the code outside




I am working as a Akshat and I need the code written by Deepak




for code pull akshat needs the repository url of Deepak code






https://github.com/deepakchanana/janBatch.git




when you are cloning the code from centralized repository it will be created automatically


conflict problem---------------------when we will discuss the git commands for code push and code pull





deepak------------------File1
Akshat------------------File2



	


we have to submit all the assignments in the git hub repository--------------we have to share the repo url in the group only
