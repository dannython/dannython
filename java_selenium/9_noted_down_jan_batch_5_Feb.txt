so today we will discuss about very good concept that is loop and condition

what is condition ?
whether a number is even or odd that is a condition

whether we will do the session today or not again that is a condition


so for condition handling we have 

if
if else
else if ladder
nested if else
switch case


these are use for the condition handling


%-----------------modules operator---------it will give the remainder to us.

after dividing a number by 2 what remainder we are getting % will give us it will be 0 or 1



= ------------------it is used for assigning the values(assignment operator)
== ----------------comparison operator 


we can mention else block as well
means either if condition will execute or else block will execute

if -----------true------------------corresponding block of if condition will execute
if it is false then else block will execute



for taking input from the user we use java predefined class that is Scanner class

so we will create the object of Scanner class


now we will discuss about else if ladder

here we have

if
else if 
else if 
else if 
else if 
else

it is not mandatory to mention the else part in the last

either if condition-----------will execute--------if it is true
if it is not true then else if---------true----------then else if will execute


implicit and explicit data type conversion




nested if else 



if

  if

  else

else

switch case--------------------------will discuss later on

*******************************************

one of the most important concept that is loop

loop is used for the repeatative task

for example i want to take 100 values will i take 100 variables ?
no we will use loop for it


there are three things required for the loop
initilization--------starting point
end point----------condition check
increment/decrement




firstly let's discuss about the flow of the loop

we have three loops
for loop
while loop
do while loop





for(int i=0;i<10;i=i+2)
   {
	   System.out.println("Welcome deepak "+i);
   }


when we know how many times loop will execute then we will go with the for loop

for example if we want to print a table we will use for loop

when we don't know how many times loop will execute then we will go with the while loop

for example we want to read the data of a txt file

we don't know how many lines/words/characters in the file we will go with the while loop


 int a=0;
   while(a<=10)
   {
	   System.out.println("Welcome deepak "+a);
	   a=a+1;
   }

we have another loop that is do while loop




int a=0;
  do
  {
	  System.out.println("value is "+a);
	  a=a+1;
  }while(a<10);
  

in the do while loop, it will execute at least once if the condition is false also because condition will be checked at the end









*********************************************





1) Swapping of two number using third variable
a=12
b=15

a=15
b=12

2) Swapping of two number without using third variable


3) A number is prime or not ---A number that will be divisble by itself or 1
4) A number is palindrome or not--121--reversel of the number
5) A number is Armstrong or not-----153----1+125+27 
6) Table print(you can print any table)
7) Factorial of a number  5------5*4*3*2*1---120
8) Fibnocci series up to 12-----------
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89
a=12
b=10

a=10
b=12


0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89


Palindrome 121---------121
Armstrong 153---------1+125+27----153

a=12
b=13

a=13
b=12
