so today we will discuss about excel file handling

how to read the data from excel file
how to write the data in the excel file

in excel we have xls format, xlsx format and csv format





so for handling the xls format we will use JXL library
for handling the xlsx format we will ues Apache POI library


what do you mean by library ?
which provides the built in classes and methods 

if we want to use those built in classes and methods we should have the corresponding jar file of that library.

we have two approaches for adding the jar file of the required library.

1) manually-----------download the jar file from google and attach the jar file using build path option
2) with the help of maven----here maven will download the jar file for us and it will attach with the project






jxl jar file

after writing the data in a excel file go to the save as option and there you need to select save as type --- 1999-2003


and after that check the file format by right click go to properties and it should be xls format






JXL library has given some classes and methods

for excel file-----------------------------Workbook class
for sheet in the excel file-------------Sheet 
for cell in the sheet -------------------Cell



getWorkbook is a method(static method) that is returning the object of the Workbook class

public static Workbook getWorkbook()
{

return new Workbook();  // it is returning the object of Workbook class
}







your question is like that for example i need the data
of 2nd row to 4th row



basically getrows() method will give you the row count the last row which is containing the data
basically getcolumns() method will give you the column count the last column which is containing the data




Workbook
Sheet
Cell
getWorkbook()
getSheet()
getrows()
getcolumns()
getCell()
getContent()
WritableWorkbook
createSheet()
createWorkbook()
Label------------------------------with the help of Label we will define the cell structure means row no column no and the data
