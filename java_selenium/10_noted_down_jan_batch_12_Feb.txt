*******************************************************

in the next session, I need all the assignments of single loop and double loop, after that i will proceed to the next topic.

what is debugging ?
debugging is a process by which we can do the analysis of the code
by which we can find out the root cause of the problem in the code
by which we can find out till which point code is working fine


for debugging we use the debug points
debug point is the point from where debugging process will start.
means after that we can execute the code line by line
from the debug point

step over---------------for moving to the next line
step into----------------for moving inside any method
step return -------------for moving back 



**********************************************************
we can use loop and condition together 
means inside condition we can use loop
means inside loop we can use condition
