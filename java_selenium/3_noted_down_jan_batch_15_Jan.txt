Type of variables
Constructor
type of constructor 
constructor vs method
importance of the constructor
why we create the constructor
this keyword


what do you mean by variable ?
which store some value and value can be change


we have two type of the variables

global variable-----------variable declared inside a class and outside a method that is global variable, we can use these variables in the whole class

local variable--------------variable declared inside a method that is local variable, we can use these variables in that method only where we have declared it



******************************************************************
Constructor----------------------

1) its like method
2) constructor name and class name will be same, whatever class name we have, our constructor name will be same
3) no return type(even we can't write void also)
4) no need to call, it will be called automatically as we create the object of the class.

how we call the method
by creating the reference_variable of the class

how we call the consturcotr
no need to call, as we create the object of the class it will be called by itself 



we have two type of the constructor
default constructor
parameterized constructor





method vs constructor


1) method can return or it can't return  
1) constructor will not return anything

2) method name can be anything
2) constructor name will always same as class name

3) in case of method, we have to call using refernece_variable
3) in case of constructor, no need to call it will be called as we create the object of the class

Problem statement

I have five global variables, and i need to assign values to those variables and I need to print the values of those variables


Solution1--------------> call the variables, assign value and print the values


10 calls for one object-----------------5 for assigning the values and 5 for printing those values

if i have 10 objects ?
how many calls will be there-------------10*10-------100 times

Solution2----------------> if i am using method for assigning the values 

total calls-------------------------------for object1--------------1+5-------6 times

if i have 10 objects ?
how many calls will be there--------------------10*6-----------------60 times


Solution3--------------------------> if  i am using constructor for assigning the values


total calls-----------------------for object1--------------------------------5 times
if i have 10 objects ?
how many calls will be there-----------------------10*5------------------------50 times




constructor is used for assigning the values for an object
and the main benefit of consturcotr is that no need to call it will be called by itself as we create the object of the class

no of calls has been reduced


for example i want to call all the constructor 




every object having its own memory







this keyword------------------------

1) for calling from one constructor to another constructor and this will be the first statement inside a constructor and we can't write more than one this statement inside a constructor


Assignment1
Output should be in the below sequence

three parameterized constructor
default constructor
one parameterized constructor
four parameterized constructor
two parameterized constructor

using this keyword and you need to create only one object





second use of this keyword
for calling from one method to another method, and in case of method you can write this statement anywhere in the method and you can write more than one this statement inside a method






Assignment2--------------

Output should be in the below sequence using this keyword

four parameterized method
default method
one parameterized method
three parameterized method
two parameterized method
