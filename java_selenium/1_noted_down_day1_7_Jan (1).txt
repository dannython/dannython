don't write anything on the paper or notepad, I will share everything
I will make notes for you
Just give attention to the session

JDK vs JRE vs JVM
Java installation
Path Variable and why we set the path variable
Eclipse setup
Class and Object(4 pillers of a java code)


JDK vs JRE vs JVM

JDK------Java Development kit----------------when we want to write the code and we want to execute the code then we must have JDK in our system.

JRE-------Java Runtime environment------when we want to only execute the code if we have JRE in our system yes we can because JRE will provide a run time environment.


JVM-----Java Virtual Machine------------------it will actually execute the code in the enviornment provided by JRE


JDK contains-------------> JRE + JVM
JRE contains------------>JVM


JDK-----contains---------JRE-------------contains------------JVM

so what we required ?
because we want to write the code and we want to execute the code that's why we need JDK in our system




download the jdk exe file from the drive link that i will share 
and just click on it and next---next and finish that's it



after downloading the exe file you need to click on that exe


after finishing the exe file you will get the java setup in your system in 
the C drive program files




C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_171\bin


copy this path till bin folder


in win7-----------path variable value will be in a single line just go to the end of the line by right arrow and put semicolon and paste your path

java -version



we required a software named eclipse

what is eclipse
its a editor(IDE)----------------like notepad

download the eclipse as per your system requirement

64 bit
32 bit

64 bit eclipse --------

https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/downloads/release/photon/R/eclipse-jee-photon-R-win32-x86_64.zip


32 bit 

https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/downloads/release/photon/R/eclipse-jee-photon-R-win32.zip

after downloading the eclipse just extract that folder

that zip folder

what is workspace ?
workspace is the location where your code will be saved in the system


what do you mean by class ?
a class represent variable + method



for printing any msg on the console we will use

syso and control + space



piller1------------------------class creation-----------------> put variable + method
piller2----------------------main method creation
java has given a predefined method that is main method and that is the entry point of the execution
code execution will start from the main method

piller3----------------------object creation inside main method
where we will create the object ?
inside main mehod

why we are creating the object ?
so that we can call/access the variable and method of the class

what is the syntex of object creation ?
classname refernece_variable=new classname();

here new keyword will create the object and after that memory will be allocated.
there will be some address of that memory.

reference_variable will point to that memory address



piller4--------------------------call the variable and method of the class using refernece_variable



Assignment--------------------
create a class named Student

put two variables age and roll_no

put two methods
display1 -----welcome to all of you
display2 -----automation is very easy

create main method
   create object
   call both the methods
   call both the vairalbe----give vlaue ----print value



recording + noted down files + notees
