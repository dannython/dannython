what are the four pillers of a java code ?
1) Class creation ------------put variable and method in it
2) main method creation
3) object creation inside main method
4) calling the variable and method using reference variable

what is the syntex of object creation
classname reference_variable=new classname();

what do you mean by method ?
for performing any operation/action we will create method for it


we have two type of the methods

user defined method
predefined method


we have two type of the user defined method

1) default method
2) parameterized method

in terms of input we have two type of the methods
default and parameterized

in terms of output we have two type of the methods
void and non void


when a method will not return any result that is void method
when we will make a method as a void method ?
when we don't need the result of that method for further use in that case we will make it as a void method

what do you mean by non void ?
when a method will return any result that is non void method
when we need the result of that method for further use in that case we will make it as a non void method


syso is not related to the void or non void
syso is just only for printing anything

there is no relationship between input and output of the method

1) a method can take the inputs and it can give the output
2) a method can take the inputs and it can't give the output
3) a method can't take the inputs and it can give the output
4) a method can't take the inputs and it can't give the output
5) a method can take different data type of inputs and it can give different data type of output

int int ---- float value

int -----------12,3456,6777
float----------12.4  33.44  


	
public int abc()
{

}


syso is only for printing


package is used for storing the classes
package is similier to the folder that store something


project---package----then class


it is mandatory to write the return statement in case of non void method

in case of void method we can't write the return statement


return is keyword that is mandatory in case of non void method

when a method will return some value, so return is the keyword use in the non void method

void--------when a method will not return any result that is void method

why you make a method as a void method
when we don't need the result of that method for further use, in that case we will make that method as a void method
