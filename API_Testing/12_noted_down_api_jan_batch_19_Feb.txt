how to explain the framework in the interview------------------
from next session onward we will start the framework practically from scratch



but today we will discuss what are the different components of our framework


we can create the object of a class in the another class----yes

how you can call the methods of httpmethod class in the test script
by creating the object of the httpmethod class


I have worked on the keyword driven framework, we were executing the testcases based upon the keyword
and for the unit testing we were using testng.  junit and testng
and rest assured is giving the support of bdd framework by default.

hybrid------------data driven + keyword driven



even you can move your keyword driven fw into hybrid as well by adding data driven approach


keyword driven---------------> hybrid  




bdd or cucumber----------rest assured is supporting the bdd 

we are not implementing rest assured is giving the support




behaviour driven development------------given() when() then()



****************************************
Keyword driven-----------execute the test cases based upon the keyword
data driven------------------when we have to test case with multiple test data that is data driven
hybrid-------------------------that is combination of data driven and keyword driven
