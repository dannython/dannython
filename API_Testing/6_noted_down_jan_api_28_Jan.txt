so today we will discuss about

post request using rest asssured library


in case of post request, body data will go or not ?
yes body data will go in case of post request.


we have three type of body data(request body data)
simple json
complex json
in form of array json


we have three ways for the body data creation
1) we can create simple,complex and in form of array data using org.json library
2) we can create simple,complex and in form of array data using json file
3) we can create simple,complex and in form of array data using pojo classes



Basically in the real time developer will give us the test data 

if body data is large-----------then second approach is better(using json file)









copy the body data create a json file and paste your body data in that json file---and read that json file using java code(that is the best approach)

simple/complex/array

1) using org.json
2) using json file
3) using pojo classes


**********************************************************************

today we will start with the org.json library


{    
"firstname" : "Deepak",
"lastname" : "Chanana",
"id" : "DC",
"designation" : "STL"
}

org.json library has given two classes 

for object notation-----------------JsonObject
for array notation-------------------JsonArray





before hitting the request what we should have
the request body data


in case of Response object we use asString() method
rest of the places we will use toString() method







I want to insert complex json data using org.json library


{ ----------------------------------------------------OuterJsonObject

          {---------------------------------------------InnerJsonObject
             Addrss details

          }

}


post request----------------

given-------------------we should have body data + body data content type 
when---------------------we are hitting post method



 [ ] ---------array can store objects
 {} ---------object store key value pair

format---------------- []   {  }





simple,complex and in form of array body data using org.json and hit the post request method


what is the reason for not using this approach ?
if your body data is large, is it good approach to write the too much code for large body data

because for each thing we have to take the classes and method for preparing the body data
for example in our body data there are 50 json object----------

900 key value--------------put statement 900 times
