so guys please don't write anything on paper or notepad.
I will make notes for you 
I will share everything
you don't need to write
just give attention to the session.

what do you mean by APIs ?
some real time example of APIs
where APIs testing come into the picture.
importance of the api testing
key points while api testing.


API is a way of communication

between frontend(UI) and the backend(database) of the application
between two different or same technologies application(component)
between two different platform application





UI Layer(Frontend Layer)
API Layer(Business Logic Layer)
DB Layer(Data base Layer)



what is the benefit of the APIs


the main benefit of the api testing is that we can find out the issues at the early stage of the product development

we can find out the issues before UI developmnet




db layer will be designed by the DBA 

after that business logic(api layer) apis will be designed by the development team

and finally UI will be designed by the development team




because we are testing the business logic(the main logic)

1) because with the help of api testing we can find out the issues in the early stage of development
2) api testing is faster comparing to the UI automation



you have to automate a feature
post a tweet msg on the tweeter application

UI automation(Frontend automation)
browser open---url hit----------maximize---------login--------tweet msg type----------click on the post button
5 mins

with the help of apis
it will take hardly 10 seconds


because api layer is closure to the db(database layer)






Postman------------------------java script
Rest Assured-----------------java
SoapUI-----------------------------groovy scripting
SoapUI Pro
Groovy Scripting


key points while api testing

1) firstly we have to verify the response(output) data that is correct or not
2) api chaining(first api----response(output) data-----we will extract something---------we will use that thing in the another api -----------that is api chaining
3) test the api with different different data(test data) 



in the real time development team will give all the information
here we are creating just for our learning purpose
