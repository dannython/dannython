testNG implementation done
how many test cases------------------total 10 test cases

FW--------------------

CI/CD implementation

like you will push the code to the git hub, before that you need to execute the code using maven.
how you will execute the code------------using maven 

you need to pass testng.xml and surefire plugin to the pom.xml and maven will execute the code.

firstly change your pom.xml -----------put the below things in that 








above dependencies tag, put the below thing

<build>
		<plugins>
			<!-- Compiler plug-in -->
			<plugin>
				<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
				<artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
				<configuration>
					<source>${jdk.level}</source>
					<target>${jdk.level}</target>
				</configuration>
			</plugin>
			<!-- Below plug-in is used to execute tests -->
			<plugin>
				<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
				<artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
				<version>2.18.1</version>
				<configuration>
					<suiteXmlFiles>
						<!-- TestNG suite XML files -->
						<suiteXmlFile>testng.xml</suiteXmlFile>
					</suiteXmlFiles>
				</configuration>
			</plugin>
		</plugins>
	</build>



After that push your code into github -------------------------




you need to give some software to the jenkins like 
jdk path 
git path
maven path

now we need to install some plugins into jenkins

Jenkins is a CI/CD tool by which we will execute our code.





In case of jenkins your manager will not open the eclipse for running the code.
your manager can click and run the thing
you can schedule the build also in jenkins
means you can specify the time that time jenkins will pull the code and it will execute the code.



in the companies devops team will do the setup of the jenkins things and they will give you the URL and credentials of the jenkins


surefire plugin is used by maven for the execution of the testng.xml
