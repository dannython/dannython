Postman-------------section pre requisite and test and assertion------------let's discuss on this

*********************************************************************

while hitting the request if there is any precondition we will keep inside pre requisite section 

after hitting the request if we want to check something we will keep inside test section


for example in our case before hitting the request we have to change the id value 

we can generate a random id in the pre requisite and we can use that id in the request body

*******************************************************

for example after hitting the request we need to parse the id value so that we can use that id value in the another api

parsing code we can keep in the test section

we need to validate the status code or we need to validate the data we can keep in the test section



here we will generate a random id that random id we will give to the local  variable that is id_value so that
that variable can be use in the request body


pre request --------whatever precondition before hitting the request we will keep here
test--------------after hitting the request whatever we want to do we will keep here

whether you have rights or not to consume the apis for that purpose dev team put the authentication

so there are different type of authentication like







api1---------------from the response you are getting the bearer token----------you need to use the bearer token in the other apis

you have to go to some web portal---------from there you can get the authenticaiton values--------you need to use those values in the other apis
