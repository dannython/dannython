so today we will discuss about 

postman introduction
hit the apis manually in the postman


what is postman

postman is a api testing tool for manual and automation.

download the exe file of the postman and click on it then next---next and finish it


for window 64 bit

https://www.postman.com/downloads/

what do you mean by collection
collection is similier to the folder

collection is used for grouping the testcases(api testcases)

it is similier to the package in the java

collection is a container




what is the benefit of the collection
for example

you have 10 api test cases of feature1
you have 10 more api test cases of feature2


how you will differentiate

collection1--------------10 api testcases of feature1
collection2---------------12 api testcases of feature2


api nov batch------------collection1
api jan batch-------------collection2



HTTP Methods

so before hitting the api testcase we have to decide which http method we want to hit

who will tell-------dev team will tell which http method we have to use

as per HTTP standard

if i want to insert a record, we will use post method

if we want to fetch the record, we will use get method

if we want to update the record, we will use put/patch method

if we want to delete a record, we will use delete method


post----------------------insert query--------for inserting a record
get------------------------select query--------for fetching the records
put/patch--------------update query--------for updating the record
delete-------------------delete query---------for deleting the record


I want to insert the record for one of the api student

firstname
lastname
id------------------------that is the mandatory key, it is similier to the primary key in DB
designation---------
course time--------
course type-------



which http status code will come 201



primary keys will be always unique





who is giving the APIs
Json-server

so if you are not giving the id, it will auto insert





in the real time, there can be any unique key, it is not only id

real time there can be any key that can be unique



the record where id ----Ravneet 

Select * from tablename where id like 'Ravneet';    http://localhost:3000/APIFolks/Ravneet






http://localhost:3000/APIFolks/X6lwsmE-------------example of path parameter




path parameter----------------------------/
query parameter-------------------------?





here in our case(the apis created by json server) here you can pass only primary key in the path parameter
in real time there can be anything with /(path parameter)


generally with path parameter we use primary key 
because in the response it will give a unique record

but for example there can be a situation you can pass any other key value 
so in the response there can be single record or multiple record





dev team will tell us

request body data(test data for apis)
which http method
response body data
URI
http status code(it is coming in the response) 



in the api specification document


API specification document/swagger/ there can be some web portal as well where dev team will update the apis information 



before delete request you can hit get all----------save the response of get all
then hit the delete request
again hit the get all---------------------------save the response of get all


as of now we are getting only one record
means we have to change the id value again and again for get a particuler record

with the help of automation we can do this thing means we can hit the request in the loop and in the loop we can change the id value by taking it from the excel file(or from csv file) or from json file

from the frontend(UI) you can take all these information





Assignment

post request
get all
get a particular with path
get a particular with qurry
get a particular with multiple query
delete record


as per the http standard post is used for inserting the record


inserting a record----------you can use get request

but as per http standard get is used for fetcing the information and here dev is saying post can be use for fetching the information

post ---as per http ----------in case of post we will get 201 status code
but as per dev imp  we can get 200 also in case of post request
