org.testing.responseValidation + Assertion implementation

now we have to implement the assertion part in our framework


Assertion means comparison between expected result and actual result

there are two type of the assertion
hard assertion----------------assertion given by testng, if hard assertion failed then code will not execute further. 
soft assertion-----------------assertion that we will create(user defined assertion) if soft assertion failed then code will execute further.


responseValidation
status code validation
data validation

how we can do the parsing from the response ?
org.json
jsonpath



firstname value should be deepak in the response


$.firstname
