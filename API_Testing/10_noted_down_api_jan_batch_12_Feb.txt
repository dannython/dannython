so today we will discuss about one of the most important topic that is parsing

parsing means extract something from the response body

why we need to parse ?

1) so that we can use that thing in the another api(we call it api chaining)
2) so that we can do the assertion(means we can compare the expected result with the actual)



api1----------------post request------------in the response we are getting id value -----------so we need that id value for the second api(that is get request) in the URI -------------so this is the concept of api chaining


for example we are hitting a api(that is the get request) in the response we are getting firstname---deepak now we have to verify whether firstname value is deepak or not... so for that thing also we have to extract firstname from the response(that is our actual value) and expected already we have. we can do the comparison


firstname--------expected----------Deepak
in the response firstname-------deepak is coming

no it is not correct it is not matching



let me take a example for second case

for example in the response i am expecting account number value must be 100101010

but in the response account number is coming 100000000

so it is correct 


here we will discuss 

1) how to extract single occurence of a value(firstname----1 time-----i need that value)
2) how to extract multiple occurent of a value(firstname----10 times----i need all the values)
3) how to extract all the values of a object "Accountinformation" ---accounthooldername, address, pincode---
so we need all the data of Accountinformation


for parsing anything from the response we have two ways

1) we can use the org.json library
2) we can use the jsonpath

so today we will discuss about org.json library for parsing the response


for example i want to extract all the ids






keySet() method is giving all the keys of jsonobject and return type of this method is Set<String> Set of String


public Set<String> abc() 
{

}

Set<String> result=  obj.abc();





After : whatever is written that is the return type of that method









single value extract
multiple values extract
object-----------key:values extract
array--------object-------key:values-------------->?

array---one loop for object
object---one loop for key:values

firstly check your json response based upon that use Jsonobject/jsonArray
